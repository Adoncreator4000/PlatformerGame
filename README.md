# PlatformerGame
A platformer i made for my resume

THIS CAN ONLY BE PLAYED ON WINDOWS!!!

The game is really simple to install and should only take one click. playing it is just as easy.

I only made this as a showcase for what i can do as a game developer. though i do believe i can do more than just that.

This was originally going to be made for a video to compare human game development vs ai game development but i never ended up giving the prompt so you can guess what happened to the video.
